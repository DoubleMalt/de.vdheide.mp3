de.vdheide.mp3
==============

Fork of Jens Vonderheide's LGPL MP3 tag reader library


### Original Text::

This is version 0.4 of the de.vdheide.mp3 package, a library to read and write 
ID3 and ID3v2 tags and read MP3 file properties.

This release consists of three files:

java_mp3-0.4-bin.zip
	Contains the precompiled library in a jar file.
java_mp3-0.4-src.zip
	Contains the source code for the library, the test cases
	and the JavaDoc documentation.
	

Release notes
=============

This is version 0.4.

This is a pure bugfix release (see the Changelog for details), it contains no 
new features.

Documentation is only present as JavaDoc created class descriptions. I will add
some examples and overview documentation later. For now, also take a look at the
test cases contained in the source archive.

I have moved the project over to BerliOS. The new project site is now
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/javamp3/. This includes a Subversion repository,
a bug tracker and mailing lists.


Future plans
============

First of all, more frequent releases. I will not give any precise dates, as that
depends on the amount of spare time that I can spend on this project.

Since I am not using the library myself (I dropped all plans on developing an
ID3 tagger), I depend on you to provide me with ideas for the further direction
of development. Patches and code is definitely preferred, but feature requests
and bug reports are welcome to.


Future versions
---------------

The next major feature will be support for ID3v2.4.0. I have not yet looked into
the standard in detail, so I cannot give you a time frame for completion.

Again, your ideas and input is welcome.
